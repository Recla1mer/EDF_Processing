# EDF File Processing

Python project for processing .edf files to retrieve ECG and wrist accelerometry signals, enabling 
calculation of RR intervals and Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD – values characterizing motion activity). 
This tool is designed to prepare data for use cases such as deep convolutional neural network-based sleep 
stage classification.

## Ensuring Smooth Data Access

Before running the code, open the file `project_parameters.py` to configure the file parameters. Here, you must 
specify which keys access the ECG and wrist accelerometry data in your .edf files. If your data uses different 
keys across files, add them all to ensure they can be accessed.

**Note:** If your data is not stored in .edf format, you can still use this project. Simply replace the 
`get_data_from_edf_channel` function in `read_edf.py` to handle your data format. Then, modify the file 
parameters (as outlined above) to specify the file type you are working with.

## Quick Start

To begin processing, open `main.py` and use the `Processing_NAKO` function (originally named for processing the 
NAKO study). Set the paths to your .edf files and define the output path for saving results. During processing, 
the program will:

- Validate ECG signal quality to determine evaluatable segments
- Detect R-peaks using specified detectors
- Calculate RR intervals from detected R-peaks
- Compute MAD from wrist accelerometry data

## Comparing Results

If you have existing results for ECG validation and R-peak detection that you'd like to compare with those
generated by this project, you can use the `Processing_GIF` function instead (named after the GIF study that 
provided these results). For this comparison, you’ll need to specify additional information, such as the path 
to the existing results.

The program will then generate two .txt files, providing a summary of correspondence between the compared 
results.
